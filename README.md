# C++ Starter project

Uses CMake, Catch2 for unit tests, and optionally Eigen if you uncomment the corresponding lines in starter.cmake

## Build instructions

``` 
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

And you can then run the example project in ``` example/example ``` and the unit tests in ``` tests/test_example ```
